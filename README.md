# Declarative text analysis through SQL

The repository contains a text mining library built on top of [YeSQL](https://github.com/athenarc/YeSQL/). 
The library maps several text mining functionalities to reusable scalar, aggregate, and polymorphic table UDFs written in Python. Due to the
performance characteristics of YeSQL and its design, the presented framework is
able to execute critical text mining analytical tasks faster than other popular solutions, and allows data scientists to implement end-to-end text analytics pipelines within a declarative extended SQL.
